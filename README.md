# Fusion360ToolInventory
A add-on/scripts to export a Fusion 360 tool library and have it automatically update a google sheet.

Tooling Inventory System

This is an open-source solution for managing a tooling inventory system integrated with Fusion 360. It uses a JSON export from Fusion 360 to automatically update a Google Sheet for tracking inventory in real time.
Features

    Automatically updates a Google Sheet whenever the Fusion 360 tool library is modified.
    Tracks essential tool attributes, including descriptions, dimensions, and vendor details.
    Simplifies tooling inventory management for machine shops.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

    Fusion 360 installed with the ability to add and use custom add-ins.
    A Google Workspace account with access to Google Sheets.
    Python installed (version 3.8 or later).
    The following Python packages installed:
        gspread
        oauth2client
        watchdog

You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install gspread oauth2client watchdog

Installation

    Clone or download this repository:
        Clone with Git:

        git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ToolingInventorySystem.git

        Or download the ZIP file and extract it to a folder.

    Set up Fusion 360 Add-In:
        Navigate to the Fusion Add-In folder.
        Copy the folder into your Fusion 360 API add-ins directory:
            On Windows: C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\AddIns
        Launch Fusion 360, enable the add-in, and verify it creates a (NameOfYourToolList_export.json) file in the folder where you specify.

    Configure the Google Sheet:
        Create a new Google Sheet titled Tool Inventory (or adjust the name in import_tool_inventory.py if you use a different name).
        Add column headers for the fields you want to track (e.g., description, vendor, product-id, etc.).
        Share the Google Sheet with the service account email from the credentials.json file.

    Prepare the Required Files:
        Place your credentials.json file in the same directory as the scripts (import_tool_inventory.py and file_change_listener.py).
        Make sure the (NameOfYourToolList_export.json) file is being generated by Fusion 360 in the same folder.

    Set Up the Watchdog Script:
        Run file_change_listener.py to monitor changes to (NameOfYourToolList_export.json). It will automatically trigger import_tool_inventory.py when the file changes.

Usage Instructions

    Run the Watchdog:
        Open a terminal in the directory where the scripts are located.
        Run the following command:

        python file_change_listener.py

        This will monitor the (NameOfYourToolList_export.json) file for changes.

    Update Fusion 360 Tool Library:
        Modify your tool library in Fusion 360 and save changes.
        The system will automatically update the Google Sheet with the latest data.

    Check the Google Sheet:
        Open the shared Google Sheet to view and manage your tooling inventory.

Customization

You can customize the system for your shop's needs:

    Modify the Column Headers in the Google Sheet to match your requirements.
    Update the Add-In Export Fields in the Fusion 360 add-in to include additional parameters.
    Change the File Paths in the scripts for your directory structure.

Troubleshooting

    File Not Found Errors: Ensure all file paths in the scripts are correct.
    Google API Errors: Verify that credentials.json is properly configured and the service account has access to the Google Sheet (should have an address that you can "share" the sheet with).
    Rate Limit Errors: The Google Sheets API has rate limits. If you encounter issues, try reducing the frequency of updates by adding delays in the script.
